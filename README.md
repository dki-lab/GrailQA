# GrailQA

Strongly **G**ene**ra**l**i**zab**l**e Question Answering Dataset (GrailQA) is a new large-scale, high-quality KBQA dataset with 64,331 questions annotated with both answers and corresponding logical forms in different syntax (i.e., SPARQL, S-expression, etc.). It can be used to test three levels of generalization in KBQA: i.i.d., compositional, and zero-shot.

For dataset and leaderboard, please refer to the homepage of GrailQA: https://dki-lab.github.io/GrailQA/. In this repo, we help you to reproduce the results of our baseline models and to train new models using our code.

## Overview
To study the three levels of generalization in KBQA, we implement a line of baseline models of different natures, namely, **Transduction+BERT**, **Transduction+GloVe**, **Ranking+BERT**, and **Ranking+GloVe**. Our implementation is based on AllenNLP 0.9.0.
